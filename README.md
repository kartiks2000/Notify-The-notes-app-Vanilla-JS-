# Notify-The-notes-app-Vanilla-JS-
designed and developed by kartik saxena


I myself feel it wasnt the most wise decision to make Notes app using just Vanilla Javascript infact i should have used some framework like reactjs etc..

But i intentionally used Vanilla Javascript to gainb more firm grip and confidence in using javascript.

currently i have not added the feature to delete a note but soon planning to....

It would be easy to add any kind of feature to the project down the line because i have made it with an approach which has scope to add new feature (specially the data management and data structure).

i was provinced a feature for ID in the project which i am not using currently but could be used in the future.


kindly dont mind the design it just that i am more a implementing guy rather than choosing colors and pictures patiently.

hope u like it.....
